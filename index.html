        <p>Hey thanks for taking a few moments to read more about me. I know your time is precious, so I'll get right to it. I want to play water polo in college as your next utility player.</p>
        <p>But this hasn't always been true, and this might not be the most interesting thing about me.</p>  
        <p>I grew up in a small town in Iowa, just outside of the university town of Ames, Iowa. Our school district didn't have a pool, so instead we played a lot of soccer. One of my teammates' dad was a well known swim coach and invited me out to swim for his club. I instantly fell in love with being in the water and being a part of the swim community.</p> 
        <p>In 2019 we moved to Rocklin, California and I joined a swim club, made the 8th grade basketball and volleyball team. Then covid happened, and the world shut down. It was difficult being in a new school and new town without the time to establish great friendships.</p>
